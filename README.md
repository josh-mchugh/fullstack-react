## Chat App
This small chat application uses ReactJS and Redux to maintain application state. Within this example there are two chat converstations with two seperate list of messages. Redux handles the application state and the React components recieve the application state changes as props. This allows the React Components to focus on rendering HTML and minimal component state.
